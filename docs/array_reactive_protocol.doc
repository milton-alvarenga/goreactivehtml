    Bits 0–1:  Operation
        00 = DELETE
        01 = UPDATE
        11 = INSERT
        (10 unused — maybe future operation)

    Bits 2–3:  Position Size Indicator
        00 = 0 bytes  (only allowed for INSERT?)
        01 = 1 byte
        10 = 2 bytes
        11 = 3 bytes

    Bits 4–5:  Data Size Indicator
        00 = 0 bytes
        01 = 1 byte
        10 = 2 bytes
        11 = 3 bytes

    Bit 6: Partial/complete update/insert
        0 = Complete
        1 = Partial

    Bit 7: Bulk Flag
        0 = single
        1 = bulk
